## About Me
Hello! I'm a first-year graduate student focusing on Transportation Engineering. I have a basic understanding of coding and am eager to learn more through this course. My main interest lies in Transit-oriented Development, and I'm excited to explore how our newfound skills can be applied in this field.
## Course Introduction
This course is an introduction to GIS and spatial data science, which are essential skills for any urban planner or researcher. We'll learn how to analyze and visualize spatial data, making it applicable to various aspects of urban planning. The course will challenge us to think critically and creatively about contemporary urban issues and how spatial data can help us address them. The course covers basic Python programming for spatial analysis.
## Project Ideas
While I haven't decided my group project topic, I'm leaning towards something related to transportation. Perhaps analyzing traffic flow and car crash data to reduce congestion and improve traffic safety.
## Class Objectives
- To learn the fundamentals of Python programming and data wrangling, and how to use various libraries and tools for spatial data science, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, geopandas, and scikit-learn.
- To understand the concepts and methods of spatial data analysis, such as spatial statistics, spatial clustering, and spatial regression, and how to apply them to real-world problems.
- To create interactive and informative maps and dashboards using tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Plotly, and Dash, and how to share them online.
- To collaborate with my classmates and instructor on group projects and assignments, and to exchange feedback and ideas.
